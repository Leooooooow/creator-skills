# Creator Monetization Risk Checker

## What this does

Run a pre-publish risk screen and return:
- **Green**: publish
- **Yellow**: revise first
- **Red**: high risk, rework

## Workflow

### 1) Parse draft content

Review:
- script text
- title/hook/thumbnail claims
- sensitive wording
- originality/reuse signals

### 2) Score risk categories (1–5)

- policy / advertiser safety
- originality / reuse
- misleading claim risk
- brand suitability

### 3) Decide verdict

Rule of thumb:
- Green: all categories <= 2
- Yellow: any category = 3
- Red: any category >= 4

### 4) Provide mitigation edits

For each yellow/red item, output:
- problem line
- safer rewrite
- confidence level

Then provide:
- top 3 highest-impact fixes
- publish-ready revised version when possible

## Quality and safety rules

- Be strict on clear policy-violation language.
- Avoid overblocking harmless content.
- Preserve original creator intent where safe.
- Do not provide policy-evasion tactics.
